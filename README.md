# ðŸ“Š K-Means Clustering from Scratch ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch. It uses images of the same scene with different color intensities to create classes for the objects in the image.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Process
1. Use images of the same scene but with different color intensities.
2. Implement the K-means clustering algorithm to create classes for the objects in the image.
3. Check the clustering results for different values of k (k=2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

## ðŸŽ‰ Results
- Analyze the clustering results for each value of k to observe how the classes for the objects in the image are formed.
